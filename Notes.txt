1. Activation Logic (versionbits.*)
Still need the versionbits.h and versionbits.cpp files. Without them, the node has no mechanism to determine when the TCCP fork becomes active.
2. Chain Parameters (chainparams.cpp)
Modify src/chainparams.cpp to define the specific activation parameters for each network (mainnet, testnet, regtest). This involves setting the bit, nStartHeight, nTimeoutHeight, and nTCCPChallengeSize for the TCCP deployment.
3. Validation Hook (validation.cpp)
Modify src/validation.cpp to call TCCP::VerifyBlock when the fork is active. This is the critical step that actually turns on enforcement of the new rule.
4. Mining Logic (miner.cpp)
A developer must modify src/miner.cpp to call TCCP::ComputeProof and add the commitment to the coinbase transaction. Without this, any miner running this software will produce invalid blocks after activation.
5. Build System (Makefile.am or similar)
The new files (tccp.cpp, tccp.h, versionbits.cpp, versionbits.h) must be added to the project's build.
